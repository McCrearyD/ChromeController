# Set up Instructions

1. Acquire a controller that is compatible with Gamepad API. The good news is it supports over 1,000 controllers. Chrome Controller has the best support available for Xbox/PlayStation controllers, however you can still customize button mappings for any 3rd party controller. <b>View an exhaustive list of supported controllers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="{{ site.supported_controllers_url | absolute_url }}">here</a></b>.
2. Before adding Chrome Controller to your browser, <b>test that your controller is detected by the Gamepad API <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="{{ site.test_controllers_url | absolute_url }}">here</a></b> with no download/installation required.
3. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="{{ site.webstore_download_url | absolute_url }}">Add Chrome Controller to your browser</a></b>.

Now sit back, relax, and start browsing at your leisure!

	Chrome Controller started out as a High School project to let me relax even harder while on my computer all day. However, recently it's gained some traction so I've hired another engineer to
	help improve stability, performance, and maintainability. With the next version release 1.0 coming mid-July 2020 there will also be an added backend which will cost money to keep up.

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.
