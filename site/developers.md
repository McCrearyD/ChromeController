     <h2><a href="#">Developers Wanted</a></h2>
     <p>Are you a developer that enjoys open source projects? Great! Chrome Controller is an open source browser extension actively looking for new contributors.</p>
</header>

An introduction to the source code and how to work with/build it can be found on the GitHub repository README: <a href="{{site.developer_guide_url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="icon fa-github" rel="nofollow"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a> Chrome Controller is built with vanilla JS for functionality, React for view logic, and uses a webpack build system. The backend is developed using Python.

If you're interested in being a backend developer, please reach out to <a href="mailto:development@chromecontroller.com">development@chromecontroller.com</a> with some details of your background, past projects, verifiable work, etc. Would love to have you part of the team!
