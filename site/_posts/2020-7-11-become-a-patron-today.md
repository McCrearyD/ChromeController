## Why Support Chrome Controller?
My name is Dyllan McCreary and I'm the original developer of Chrome Controller. It started as a fun high school project to let me relax even harder while on my computer all day. From my bed! Now it's gained some traction and I've hired another engineer to take care of the project. Currently it's very buggy and in beta, but this month (July 2020) I'm shooting for an official version 1 release with more stability & performance + features!

But it's very expensive to maintain a project like this. With artwork, maintenance, hosting, etc. So I'm asking for your help. :)

## What Will Your Contribution Fund?

Your generous contributions will help fund future versions of Chrome Controller to improve stability, performance and add new features. It will also help support the backend (currently in development) namely by aggregating user settings and log user events and bug reports more effectively.
