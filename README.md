# Chrome Controller (Browser Extension)

**If you enjoy the extension, consider [buying me a coffee](buymeacoff.ee/mccrearyd) :)**

Equipped with a secondary mouse cursor for your controller and on screen keyboard, you can browse in leisure from a distance! Supports any [Gamepad API compatible controller](https://html5gamepad.com/controllers/) via bluetooth & wired connections. Supported controllers include but are not limited to: Xbox 360/1 and PlayStation 3/4.

**Note**: Chrome Controller is **currently in beta**. Version 1 official release is scheduled for July 2020 with tons of bug fixes, performance increase, and hopefully new features! Please report any issues by email to support@chromecontroller.com
